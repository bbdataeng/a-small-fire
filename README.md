# aSmallFHIR

FHIR converter/transformer “toolkit” developed by the BBMRI-IT team to support the Transform step of the ETL process. 

The toolkit is based on the open source FHIR RESOURCES library available at https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources.

<!-- The toolkit uses the [CRC-ADOPT](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5c9716d4e&appId=PPGMS) common data model. -->

## Basic Model 

Minimal denominators' findable in the Federated Platform tools:  

* Donor/Clinical Information
    - Patient_ID
    - Gender                  
    - Diagnose ICD-10
    - Diagnosis Age Donor 
    - Date of Diagnosis


* Sample
    - Sample_ID
    - Donor Age
    - Sample Type             
    - Sampling Date 
    - Storage Temperature     

## Modules

The main modules of the converter are:

**Conversion:** overall wrapper, takes as input one excel (classic dataset table) and creates the FHIR-structured JSON to be uploaded on the Biobank Locator. 

**Configuration:** contains a series of configuration values such as the organization id and the locator URL.

**Normalization:** the normalization module maps many non-compliant fields to a series of normalized fields, according to BBMRI implementation guide.

**INPUT-MODELS:** contains all the possible values for the input employed in the validation and normalization process, according to MIABIS cdm.

The FHIR final JSON is built by two separate modules: 

**FHIR-MODEL:** this module is the high-level converter from the dataset to the FHIR  

**FHIR-RESOURCES:** is employed by the FHIR-MODEL module and maps each field / entity to its FHIR counterpart 

## Requirements
``` shell
pip install -r fhir_converter/requirements.txt
```

<!-- Mandatory colnames:

-SEX

-DIAGNOSIS

-DATE_DIAGNOSIS

-DOB

-YEAR_OF_SAMPLE_COLLECTION

-SAMPLE_MATERIAL_TYPE

-STORAGE_TEMPERATURE

-PATIENT_ID

-SAMPLE_ID -->


## Configuration Files

There are two main configuration files:

- `biobank_config.yml`: Contains general configuration information such as the organization ID, the collection ID and server URL.

- `mapping_config.yml`: Defines the mapping of local data into MIABIS CDM fields.

## Usage

``` shell
cd fhir_converter
convert.py --filename "../fhir/data/<INPUT_XLSX>" --outdir "../fhir/output"
```

## Output

* `organization.json`: bundle that contains the resources Organization and Collection

* `bundle-<BUNDLE_ID>.json`: bundle that containsin the resources Patient, Specimen, Condition of the input .xlsx file
